                <h2>Education</h2>
                <br>
                <p> From May 2021 to August 2022, I undertook a Software Development in Information Technology 
                    program at Southern Alberta Institute of Technology (SAIT), which I have now successfully 
                    completed and received a diploma. This program spanned a period of approximately one year 
                    and four months and was specifically designed to equip students with knowledge and skills 
                    related to software development for information technology. My diploma serves as evidence 
                    of my proficiency in this field, which I acquired through my rigorous studies at SAIT. With 
                    my education and newly-acquired skills, I am well-prepared to embark on a career in software 
                    development.<br>
                    <br>
                    The diploma was conferred upon me by SAIT, following my completion of the program with 
                    satisfactory grades. The program was aimed at providing students with the necessary qualifications 
                    and practical training required to excel in the field of software development. By obtaining this d
                    iploma, I have demonstrated my competence in areas such as programming languages, software design, 
                    and database management. Overall, my time at SAIT has been incredibly valuable in preparing me for 
                    a successful career in the software development industry.

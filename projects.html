            <p><span>Trvlar Application: </span>Over an 8-month period as a student intern at Trvlar, I undertook a capstone 
                project that involved designing and building a platform. This platform has the ability to keep track of the 
                whereabouts of friends and acquaintances. Additionally, it offers various features that allow users to customize 
                their profiles, explore maps, and create wishlists. The platform also enables communication between users through 
                a chat function that is accessible upon login. <br>
                <br>
                During my time at Trvlar, I collaborated with my colleagues to create a cutting-edge platform that meets the needs 
                of users who desire to keep track of the locations of their friends. The platform provides several features, 
                including a customizable profile, exploration of maps, and the ability to create wishlists. Additionally, the 
                platform incorporates a chat function that allows for seamless communication between users. This feature requires 
                users to log in before they can utilize it. <br>
                <br>
                Overall, my experience at Trvlar was fulfilling, as I was able to work on an innovative project that has the 
                potential to transform the way people connect with one another.</p>

            <p><span>Snake Game: </span>Using C# programming language with Visual Studio as an Integrated Development Environment 
                (IDE), I created a game called "snake game" for computers. The game has a specific goal, which is to guide the snake
                through a given map, collecting food while avoiding collisions with the snake's own tail or the boundaries of the 
                playing area. As the player eats more food, the snake's tail grows longer, which makes the game more challenging as 
                the player navigates the snake.<br>
                <br>
                To achieve this goal, I utilized C# programming language to design and implement the game mechanics, including the 
                snake's movement, food collection, collision detection, and tail growth. The Visual Studio IDE provided a range of 
                development tools, including debugging, code analysis, and testing, to ensure that the game operates correctly and 
                efficiently.<br>
                <br>
                The game has a simple yet engaging gameplay mechanic that requires the player to react quickly and think strategically. 
                The objective is to collect as much food as possible while avoiding obstacles and challenges along the way. With every 
                successful move, the player gains points, while collisions result in a game over. The longer the snake's tail becomes, 
                the more challenging it is to navigate the snake through the map, creating a more engaging and exciting gaming experience
                for the player.</p>
